# Workspace Setup

## Create a free Glitch account

Sign up for Glitch to create a free account. Glitch works fully in the web browser, meaning you don't have to install anything. You can sign up using your university's email address. Or you can use an existing Facebook or Google account to sign up:

{% embed url="https://glitch.com/signin" %}

Glitch is all you need to get coding with HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is the code editor we'll be using throughout all tutorials that involve theses 3 languages.
