# Coding with Python

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Python Tutorial Visually@2x (1).png>)

## Learning Path

At first, you need to setup your workspace and install Python and Visual Studio Code:

{% content-ref url="workspace-setup.md" %}
[workspace-setup.md](workspace-setup.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Once we have a working development environment, let's dive right in and write our first lines of code:

{% content-ref url="first-program.md" %}
[first-program.md](first-program.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Now that we know what we're talking about, we'll try to get a more general understanding of what a program actually is:

{% content-ref url="what-is-a-program.md" %}
[what-is-a-program.md](what-is-a-program.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
