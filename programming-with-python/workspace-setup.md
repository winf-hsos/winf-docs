# Workspace Setup

## Using Python in the Cloud

For this tutorial, the easiest way to get started is to use PythonAnywhere, a development environment for Python that runs entirely in the cloud. This means you don't have to install anything on your computer. You can sign up for a free account now, it'll take 2 minutes:

For this tutorial, I am assuming that you use [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/). All descriptions and screenshots will be made for and from this environment.

## Use a Local Python Installation

While not required for this beginner's tutorial, running a local installation of Python has some benefits. One major benefit is that you can access local USB ports and hardware that is connected to your computer. We need this feature when we program with IoT devices in the tutorial [Building IoT Applications](broken-reference). As mentioned, for this tutorial you can use [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) and I'll assume that you do for the rest of this tutorial.
