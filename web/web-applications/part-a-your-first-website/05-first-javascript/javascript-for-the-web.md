# JavaScript for the Web

JavaScript is one of the 3 languages we need to create modern websites. In the old days, when websites were static and did not focus much on user interaction, we only needed HTML and CSS. Everytime we want something to happen on our website _after_ the page is loaded, we need JavaScript to help us.

But what exactly can we do with JavaScript in the context of as web app?

1. We can add actions to buttons or other elements, so that they do something when we click them.
2. We can change the HTML elements, attrtibutes (the DOM) after has been loaded.
3. We can call web services and get data from somewhere else and dynamically show that information on our web app.

On top of that, JavaScript is a complete programming language that lets us implement any algorithm we want or need. Combined with the ability to change the DOM, JavaScript becomes a powerful and indispensable tool for any modern web app.
