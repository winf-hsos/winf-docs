  The first step to a solution is creating a common understanding of the
  problem. We introduce a model to describe a problem in terms of its inputs,
  computation, and outputs.

# 5 Framing the Problem ‚≠ê



<details>

<summary>Summary</summary>

In this lesson, you'll learn:

* How we can describe a problem by its inputs, required computation, and outputs.
* That knowing the inputs and expected outputs to a problem is essential to solving it with the help of a computer.
* How breaking down a large and complex problem into smaller ones is an essential problem-solving strategy

The LiFi project presents a complex problem to solve, perhaps even too complex. A necessary first step toward a solution is to analyze the problem and possibly break it down into smaller chunks.
