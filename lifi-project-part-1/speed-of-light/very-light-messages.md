# Very Light Messages ‚≠ê

<details>

<summary>Summary</summary>

In this lesson, you'll learn:

* Why it can be difficult to synchronize the sender (LED) and the receiver (color sensor) when communicating over light.
* How a different approach could look like that doesn't rely on time synchronization.

This lesson is relevant for [Exercise 5: Speed Of Light](https://github.com/winf-hsos/lifi-exercises/raw/main/exercises/05\_exercise\_speed\_of\_light.pdf).
