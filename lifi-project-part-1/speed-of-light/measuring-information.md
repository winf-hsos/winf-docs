# Measuring Information

<details>

<summary>Summary</summary>

In this lesson, you'll learn:

* That you can think of bits as answering questions with either "yes" or "no".
* How you can efficiently guess a random number (or any symbol from an ordered sequence) by dividing the search space in half with each guess.
* How you apply this concept to determine the number of bits required for a message with a given length and set of symbols.
* What formula you can use to determine the size of a message.

This lesson is relevant for [Exercise 5: Speed Of Light](https://github.com/winf-hsos/lifi-exercises/raw/main/exercises/05\_exercise\_speed\_of\_light.pdf).
