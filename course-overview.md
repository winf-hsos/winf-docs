## Learning Objectives

The LiFi-project covers many **aspects of the digital world and its interfaces to the analog world**. In fact, it was designed so that it touches many things that I would otherwise have introduced in my lectures. Occasionally, this may seem a bit artificial, but I believe the topics are much better understood when introduced during a real-world project.

When we introduce the digital world, we will inevitably talk about **how digital computers work** on a very high level. I want you to acquire an understanding of how these universal machines can do so many tasks with such high precision and speed.

At the same time, you will learn how to write programs with the Python programming language. The goal of the project is not to learn Python particularly. We could have used a different programming language for that matter. Rather, the goal is to learn **the basics of programming and algorithmic thinking**, which are universal and can be applied beyond Python or even programming.  In the end, programming is **solving problems**.

## Concept

### Examination

The sections marked with a ‚≠ê contain a programming exercise that you need to solve together with a partner. You need to submit your code solution by a fixed deadline. The exact deadlines will be communicated at the beginning of the semester. The exercises are reviewed, and you can either pass or fail them. There are 12 exercises in total, and you need to successfully pass 10 of them to be allowed to participate in the oral exams at the end of the semester.
