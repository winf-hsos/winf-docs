# Course Overview

## Key Questions

In this course, we aim to answer three key questions, as illustrated above. For each question, we need to understand specific subtopics that are shown underneath. I will remind you of the relevant subtopic as we move through the lessons of the course. This approach will help you keep track of our progress and maintain a clear understanding of where we are in the big picture.

## Learning Objectives

The LiFi-project covers many **aspects of the digital world and its interfaces to the analog world**. In fact, it was designed so that it touches many things that I would otherwise have introduced in my lectures. Occasionally, this may seem a bit artificial, but I believe the topics are much better understood when introduced during a real-world project.

When we introduce the digital world, we will inevitably talk about **how digital computers work** on a very high level. I want you to acquire an understanding of how these universal machines can do so many tasks with such high precision and speed.

At the same time, you will learn how to write programs with the Python programming language. The goal of the project is not to learn Python particularly. We could have used a different programming language for that matter. Rather, the goal is to learn **the basics of programming and algorithmic thinking**, which are universal and can be applied beyond Python or even programming.  In the end, programming is **solving problems**.

## Exercises

To complete this project, you must solve the exercises listed below. Each exercise usually subsumes 3 lessons. The lessons marked with a ⭐ indicate the end of such a 3-lesson block. To successfully solve the exercise posted at the end of the ⭐-lesson, you need to have worked through all previous lessons.

* [Exercise 1: Ready, Set, Smoke](https://github.com/winf-hsos/lifi-exercises/raw/main/exercises/01\_exercise\_ready\_set\_smoke.pdf)
* [Exercise 2: Logic with the LED](https://github.com/winf-hsos/lifi-exercises/raw/main/exercises/02\_exercise\_logic\_with\_the\_led.pdf)
* [Exercise 3: The Human Operator](https://github.com/winf-hsos/lifi-exercises/raw/main/exercises/03\_exercise\_human\_operator.pdf)
* [Exercise 4: Digitizing the Physical World](https://github.com/winf-hsos/lifi-exercises/raw/main/exercises/04\_exercise\_digitizing\_the\_physical\_world.pdf)

* [Exercise 9: Our Secret Code](https://github.com/winf-hsos/lifi-exercises/raw/main/exercises/09\_exercise\_our\_secret\_code.pdf)

## Important Terms And Concepts

You will notice that some words in this course are highlighted in <mark style="background-color:green;">**bold green color**</mark>. I use this formatting to point you to important terms and concepts that you should know and be able to explain. It is not necessarily explained in the same lesson or in this course at all. If you can't find anything here directly or in the provided literature, make sure you do your research and ask questions during sessions.

## Introduction Of Hardware ⚡

We use four different hardware devices during the LiFi-project. They are introduced in a dedicated lesson of the course and are marked with a ⚡, so you can find them easily.
