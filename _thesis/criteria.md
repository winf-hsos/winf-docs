# Three major criteria
There are three major areas that play a role in the evaluation of a thesis:

1. Thesis' level of ambition 
2. Result's depth and quality
3. Quality of result presentation (written document / oral presentation)

There is no order of importance, rather the 3 areas are interdependent. It is important that you pay attention to all of them if you want to succeed with your thesis.

# Thesis' level of ambition

There two ways to apply for a thesis: You can apply for one of the topics listed on my website, or you can present your own idea and convince me to supervise a thesis about your own topic. Both ways are equally valid. Either way, working out the details of your topic and setting your goals is up to you. If you apply for a topic from my list, you still need to narrow down the topic and define a scope that is feasible within 3 months. If you bring your own idea, this is even more important and maybe even harder to do. However, in defining your topic you create the first result of your thesis, and it's a very important one: Your thesis' scope and goals set the boundaries of what you can ultimately achieve. This is true from a result's perspective, but also from a grade's perspective. A highly ambitious endeavor with interesting scientific questions has a higher potential to receive a very good grade than a poor and less ambitious one. Even worse, a poorly defined topic or a topic with low ambitions might be excluded to receive a very good grade from the outset. Keep in mind that this first step of choosing and defining a topic is very important. Though I assist you with this, the result is ultimately up to you!

# Result's quality and depth

For your thesis, you will ultimately end up with one or more research or application-oriented questions. To answer these questions in a scientific manner is your focus during the 3 months of your thesis. 

The same questions can be answered with different levels of quality and depth. You can scratch the surface of a topic to answer a question, or you can dig down deeply and consider different perspectives. The latter is of course preferable, but not always feasible within 3 months. Again, that's why defining the scope of your thesis is so important.

# Quality of result presentation

You achieved great results and you feel you have covered the topic of your thesis and you found satisfying answers to your research questions? That's great, and very important. But now comes the part where you have to *communicate* your findings. And this is by no means easy to do and requires a lot of thoughts, reading and writing (and re-writing).

Among others, the following list gives you questions that you should ask youself:

- Is my language easy to understand?
- Do I use the appropriate terminology
- Is my work cohesive? Do all sections and paragraphs serve a clear purpose?
- Are my figures of a high quality and do they adhere to scientific standards?
