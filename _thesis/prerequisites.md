# Nice to have

If there are more applicants than available seats, the following rules apply:

- The more elective modules you completed, the better.
- The better your average grade with respect to my modules, the higher your chances.
- Applicants with a successful *Project 2 (P2)* under my supervision are favored, especially if the topics are connected.
