## Online resources

### Python Reference Sheet

You can find a reference sheet tailored to the LiFi project and the command we introduce under the following link: [Python Reference Sheet for the LiFi Project](https://github.com/winf-hsos/lifi-exercises/raw/main/python_introduction/lifi_python_reference_sheet.pdf)

### Code Examples

The LiFi-code GitHub repository contains all code examples for this project and more. I recommend you check out the repository, so you can run the examples on your local computer. You find the instructions for the necessary software in [development-environment.md](lifi-project-part-1/development-environment.md "mention").
