## :arrow\_forward: Learning Unit

### :one: Ideation Workshop

Before we introduce the Internet of Things (IoT) in the next step, let's first brainstorm in groups to come up with our own ideas for IoT projects.

* Browse through the list of devices on the [Tinkerforge website](https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/).
* Imagine you connect 3-4 (up to 8) of theses devices to build something useful or interesting.

Write down the devices that your group needs to create their prototype. Also, write a short summary of what your prototype should be able to do.
