### :two: AI & Machine Learning

#### Introduction

Now, we'll formally introduce the topic by looking at one or two definitions and get an overview of the field of AI and in particular machine learning as a sub field.

### :three: Example: Hand Writing Recognition

Among the famous introductory examples for machine learning is the [MNIST data set](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). This data set contains \~70.000 images of hand written digits along with the information about the number that the image represents (in ML terms::label:labels). We'll explore how computer algorithms can learn to recognize these images and predict the correct number.

#### Video: But what _is_ a neural network? :tv:&#x20;

A large part of today's machine learning applications use artificial neural networks (ANN) as the underlying structure and learning algorithm. ANNs have proven to be very versatile in what functions they can learn, and the popular sub field :label:deep learning focuses on ANNs with many hidden layers.

The following video explains what a neural network is and how it works using the example of hand writing image recognition:
