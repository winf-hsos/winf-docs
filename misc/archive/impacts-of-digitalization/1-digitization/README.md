# #1 Digitization

## :dart: Learning Objectives

* You know how a computer works and you understand that everything a computer does arises from very simple operations that require only one type of device, but many of them: the NAND gate.
* You understand how digitization works, and how computers represent things from the analog world in binary digits.

## :key: Key Points

* :key: Our numbering system that we use everyday is based on the number 10. However, there are different numbering system. One that is particular interesting is the :label:binary system.\

* :key: All computers run on the binary system. That means all they know are:digit\_zero: and :digit\_one:. The binary system is a good fit for computers, because we can represent zeroes and ones as electricity being on or off.\

* :key: We know that computers can handle more than ones and zeroes: They calculate with any numbers, they process images, the play music and videos, and they come up with answers when we ask them a question. To represent all those things, computers use :label:codes.\

* :key: On a basic level, all computers do is simple arithmetic and logic. All they need for this is one simple and very small device: The NAND-gate, which is a so called :label: logic gate.\

* :key: The power of computers stems from the fact that we can put billions of logic gates (or integrated circuits, which are basically an ensemble of logic gates) on a very small chip, and that they operate nearly at the speed of light. Gordon Moore famously predicted that we can double the number of theses devices on a computer chip every 18 month, which leads to an exponential increase of computing power. At the same time we see an exponential decrease in the price for computer hardware. This is known as :label:Moores Law and it holds true still today.
