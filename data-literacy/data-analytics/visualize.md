# Visualize

## Simple visualizations within Databricks notebooks

For quick and simple visualization, Databricks has some built-in functionality that will cover many of your visualization requirements when it comes to exploring the data.

## Using a plotting library in Databricks

The built-in visualization capabilities in Databricks are sufficient for exploring the data. When you need high quality visualization with more flexibility, you can switch to a plotting library in Python or R such as [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

## Visualization with Tableau

If you'd rather use a tool with a visual user interface, you can use Tableau. Tableau is a professional BI tool with a clear focus on visualizations. A drawback is that you have to export your data set from Databricks first and then load it in Tableau. (Unless you are using the paid version of Databricks, in which case there exists a connector for Tableau).
