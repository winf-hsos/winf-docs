# Questions & Hypotheses

## Open vs. closed questions

Questions you have regarding your data can be either open or closed questions. Closed questions can be answered by a simple _yes_ or _no_, or by a number. Some examples for closed questions include:

* Do we see fewer tweets on weekends? (answer: yes / no).
* How many tweets in our sample contain the hashtag #covid19? (answer: some definite number).
* What is the percentage of tweets that deal with the corona crisis in our sample (answer: some percentage).
* When did we see the first tweet containing a reference to the corona crisis? (answer: a single date).

In contrast, open questions cannot be answered by a single number or a yes or no. Examples include:

* How did the corona crisis change the perception of Angela Merkel in the Twitter community?
* How do people on Twitter perceive the lock down measurements?
* How is the scientific community communicating about the corona crisis?

Because there is no single answer to an open question, we cannot answer it with a single SQL statement (in contrast to a closed question). To answer an open question, we need think about a strategy how to tackle the question. This strategy will contain different areas and sub-questions in theses areas that we have to find answers to. Once we answered all sub-questions, we can put the puzzle together, interpret the results, and hopefully give a satisfying answer to the open question.

## Hypotheses

A hypothesis is a factual statement about the world that we can test. In our case, we can test it using our data set and the tools we acquired to analyze that data. Notice that we can easily transform a closed question into a statement or hypothesis:

* Question: Do we see fewer tweets on weekends?
* Hypothesis: There are fewer tweets on weekends!

So whether we express our hypothesis as a statement or a closed question is secondary.
