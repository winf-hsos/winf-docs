  In some cases the interesting information seems to be hidden in a clump of
  unstructured and therefore seemingly inaccessible data. In this case, we have
  to project some structure on the data first.

# Analyze Unstructured Data

The figure below contains some typical examples for unstructured data and what kind of structured data we can derive from it. Once we have the structured data, we can apply our standard techniques for analysis, such as calculations, counting, or filtering.

## Project structures on text data

### Words (Tokens)

### Parts of speech

### Named Entities
