## Links

The official documentation website contains a number of tutorials for different kinds of visualization scenarios. I encourage everyone to browse through the examples and try new visualizations on your own.

I highly recommend the free online book "Fundamentals of Data Visualizations". Especially chapter 5, which gives you a quick introduction on when to use which type of plot:
