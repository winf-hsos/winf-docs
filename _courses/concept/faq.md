# How to enroll?

You must enroll for all modules via [OSCA](https://osca.hs-osnabrueck.de). In addition, please also sign-up for [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/winf-hsos/signup), which is used for all communication outside the classroom. After you signed up, I will add you to the channel(s) of the respective module(s) you enrolled for via OSCA.

# How do we communicate?

The platform for communication outside of the classroom for all courses is **Slack**. You can reach our Slack team at this link:

- [Goto WINF-HSOS on Slack](https://winf-hsos.slack.com)

If you haven't signed up yet, you can do so here: 

- [Sign-up for WINF-HSOS](https://join.slack.com/t/winf-hsos/signup)

You can only sign-up with your university's email adress `<your-name>`**@hs-osnabrueck.de**.

# When can I write on Slack?

Anytime. The recipient is responsible to set notifications according to her preferences.

# Does Slack have a mobile app?

Yes, great ones for each OS.

# Is there a guide to Slack?

# Which channel on Slack is for what?

`#general`

Communication relevant to all students, not limited to one course or semester

`#app`

Communication relevant to this website you are currently reading. Feedback, bugs, anything.

`#itissues`

Anything related to software we are using within the courses. Post if the questions is of interest for others or if others might know the answer.

`#ws<xy>_<course-identifier>`

The specific channels for each course and semester. All communication that is specific to the course goes here.

# Can we bring our smartphones?

Yes, please make sure you bring your smartphones to our classes. We are using them to answer polls and quizzes interactively. If you don't own a smartphone, your computer will do too.

Please make sure to mute your smartphone (no vibration either) so you don't disturb other people.

# What about exams?

All modules apply the so called *Portfolioprüfung*. That means there is no big final exam at the end. Instead, the examination is a mix of usually two types:

1. Short multiple choice exams during the semester (3-4 per semester à 20 min.)
2. A semester-spanning project work as a group (plus possible presentation of results)

This approach aims to closer mirror the learning process. In addition, students have one less exam at the end of the semester.

**NOTE:** Any announcements in the class override the statement above.

# Is there a limit of participants per module?

Currently not. This might change in the future, depending on demand.

# How can I print the slides?

If you really want to print the slides, there is an easy way to do it:

1. Open a slide deck in Google Chrome
2. Append `?print-pdf` at the end of the URL of the slide deck (click on a slide deck's link and simply edit the browser's address bar). Make sure you remove any slide number from the URL, the `?print-pdf` must directly follow the last `/`, as in `.../decks/web_engineering/00_organizational/?print-pdf#/`
3. Press Ctrl + P to open the print dialog
4. Select "Save as PDF" as target
5. Check the option "Hintergrundgrafiken" (or "Background Images")
6. Hit "Save"
