# Wirtschaftsinformatik

This is the introductory course on *Wirtschaftsinformatik*. Everyone has to complete it in the second semester, as it's a mandatory course (in contrast to the rest of the modules, which are all elective). The goal of this course is to build a foundation of IT knowledge that helps you survive in your future job. The second - and for me personally more important goal - is to get you curious about IT and discover the possibilities and benefits you can get from it. I am happy if I can motivate a couple of you to elect one of the other modules on IT in the subsequent semesters.

# Information Management

IT systems are all about managing information, which is a special form of data. In this course, you are learning important concepts and tools to manage information. A strong focus here is on databases and SQL. You also learn how companies employ IT systems, and more specific Business Intelligence (BI) and Analytics, to leverage information to their advantage.

# Impacts of Digitalization

This course is a 360 degree view of what is currently happening with Digitalization and how technologies and trends affect businesses. We first discover what the terms *Digitization* and *Digitalization* actually mean and what happens if digitize something. We then look at current technologies that arise from digitalization, such as Articificial Intelligence (AI) or the Internet of Things (IoT), and how they are applied to solve problems in relevant industries. We also talk about how business models change in the digital age and what patterns we can observe on the market.

# Applied Analytics

This course connects seamlessly to the module *Information Management*, where you have learned how to manage data with databases. This course focuses on analyzing that data to get the most value out of it. You get to know tools that help you analyze and visualize data, and you learn about methods and algorithms to classify data or to make predictions based on data. For this purpose we scratch the surface of machine learning - an exciting hot topic in any business.

# Web Engineering

It has never been easier to create a web-based business than today. That is due to the broad availabilty of cloud services that help you create your own business from existing pieces without reinventing the wheel. In this course, we get to know some important cloud services and platforms and how to apply and combine them for our purposes. But before that, we start with some basics: How does the WWW work? What is HTML and CSS? How do I write my own website with pure HTML?
