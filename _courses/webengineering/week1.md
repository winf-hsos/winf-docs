## Introduction to Web Applications

We begin by looking at different types of applications on the web. This is important, as each type requires different concepts and technologies. 

You'll learn:

- What is the difference between a static and a dynamic website?
- What is a (web) server, and what is a client?
- What characterizes a web *application*?
- How do websites, web applications and mobile apps relate to each other?
- What are typical types of web applications and what are their characteristics?
- What do we need to develop a website?

3. Project Teams & Goal Definition


<!-- end-activities -->

<!-- project -->
During the first week we are not doing much project work yet. The goals for this week are rather:

- Team up in groups of three
- Define your project goal until next week


## Tips for Project Goal Definition

Meet in your group and brainstorm ideas for a website or web app that your team can build during the next 8 to 12 weeks. The app doesn't have to be fully developed during this time (and probably won't be). Instead, we're aiming at a functional prototype. 

When coming up with an idea, please consider the following:

- Make sure that users or customers play a role in your business idea
- At best, it is actually an idea you think would be of value for someone
- It doesn't have to be a completely new idea, copying something existing is fine. You can always make a better copy.

For now, you only need to be able to describe the idea. We'll work the details out in class.
