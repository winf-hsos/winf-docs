# Curriculum

The figure below shows the learning objectives on a content level week by week. The course is divided into three blocks. The first block introduces basic web engineering concepts and technologies. In the second block, we look at advanced topics such as dynamic content and user authentication. We also explore options how to master these challenges with out of the box cloud services. In the third block you get to vote for one of three options. Depending on interest we can continue with the group projects and dig deeper into advanced concepts and functionality. The second option is to get an introduction to the development of smartphone apps. Here, the group projects could also be continued and enhanced with a prototypical app. The third option is to learn how to setup a e-commerce shop using an existing solution on the market.
