## User Registration

Before a user can sign in, she needs to be registered with your application so the system knows who she is. This is called _user registration_.

You may be familiar with different registration processes, the most common one being via e-mail and password. But more and more you can also register with an existing account from Google, Facebook or Twitter (and others). This has the benefit that you don't have to create yet another account. We'll refer to this as _social login_. Both types of registration is are supported in Firebase.
