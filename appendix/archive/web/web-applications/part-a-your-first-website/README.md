# #1 Deine erste Webseite

In the first part of this course, we'll introduce 3 languages that form the basis for any modern website: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML describes the structure of a website. That is, what elements such as text, images, links or tables should the website contain? Which headings and subheadings do we use to structure the content?

CSS takes care of the appearance of the website. Which fonts and colors does our website use? How is the content's layout on our website? How should the website appear on a small screen like a mobile device (_responsiveness_)?

Finally, JavaScript makes our website interactive and functional. Without JavaScript, there wouldn't be much to do for a user. What should a button do when clicked? What dynamic content should be loaded from a server and when?
