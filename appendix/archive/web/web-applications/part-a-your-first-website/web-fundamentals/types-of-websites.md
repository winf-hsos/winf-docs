# Types of Websites

## Static is how it all began

When in 1994 the first companies started using the internet, in most cases the purpose of a company website was to present information to their (potential) customers. (Few [early pioneers](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/230620) were alredy into e-commerce). This information was static and included the company's service offering, their service hours or contact information. Websites were written in HTML and CSS, and looked pretty bad by today's standards. For illustration, I posted the screenshot below that shows what Amazon.com looked like right after its launch in 1995.
