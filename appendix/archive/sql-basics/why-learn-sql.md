# Why learn SQL?

## SQL skills are door openers

SQL is the standard language for querying data. Good knowledge opens doors for you in many projects and areas of a company.

## SQL is problem solving

By learning SQL, you train your brain in handling data - regardless of the actual use of SQL. At the same time, you will train your problem solving skills: How do I break down a complex problem into smaller, manageable tasks and which tools do I use?

## SQL is an indispensable tool in data analysis

With SQL, we can reduce large and complex data to its essentials with little effort. We can transform data from one form to another. With SQL, we can overcome the limits of tools like Excel and independently take care of our personal information needs.

### Examples

For the last point, which is a concrete functional argument, I would like to show a few examples.

SQL enables us to reduce complex and large data and thus prepare for visualization in Tableau or Excel, or for further processing. In the slides below, you can see a few examples of visualizations that are based on around 1 million tweets. And that is still a comparatively small data set. The _amount_ of date we can handle is basically unlimited when using scalable tools like [Databricks](https://databricks.com/). Not so with limited tools like Excel.

Here is the video from one of my speeches, which is also where the slides above are from:

Another exciting video that shows visualizations based on very large amounts of data. These can be prepared using SQL as well:
