# Learning Challenges

## Examples of surprise

* A programmer trained an AI to play Tic Tac Toe on a possibly infinitely sized field. When it played against other rule-based AIs, after a certain number of games, the AI would suddenly always win. What was the brilliant strategy it had found? It simply made a move as far away from the last as possible and thereby making the board almost infinitely large. As a consequence, the rule-based programs had to check all fields between the previous and the current move, which eventually led to memory problems or timeouts. In any case, they didn't make a next move and the AI won the game.

## Examples for failures

* A particular AI had problems recognizing sheep when they weren't in their typical environment of a green landscape. It turned out the AI has learned to label this green landscape in the background with the word "sheep". When a sheep was inside a house, it was likely detected as being a dog or a cat.
* AI was trained on images with healthy skin and skin that had cancer. The AI eventually learned to recognize rulers in pictures: Many of the cancer tumors had been photographed with a ruler next to them.
