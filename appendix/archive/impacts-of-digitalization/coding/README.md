## :key: Key Points

:key: A program is a series of commands that, when the program is run, the computer executes in the prescribed order.

:key: Javascript is a modern and popular programming language. Javascript originates from web applications, where it is still most widely used. It runs in the background of every browser when you open a web page. However, in recent years, a server-side version of Javascript called :label:Node.js conquered the developer world. Node.js programs can run anywhere, not just in a browser. For example, we can run Node.js on a small computer such as the :label:Raspberry Pi, which makes it a great programming language for :label:Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

:key: There are some concept that you'll find in almost any programming language. Mastering these concepts is the key to algorithmic thinking:&#x20;

* Variables
* IF-THEN-ELSE statements (or control  structures)
* Loops&#x20;
* Objects
* Properties
* Functions&#x20;
