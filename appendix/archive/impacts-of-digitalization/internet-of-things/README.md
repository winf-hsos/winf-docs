# #3 Internet of Things

> Arguably, the first Internet of Things (IoT) application debuted on the 22nd of November 1993 when a camera at the University of Cambridge was aimed at a coffee pot to provide several computer science researchers, located on a different floor, some indication of when the coffee would be “on”.
