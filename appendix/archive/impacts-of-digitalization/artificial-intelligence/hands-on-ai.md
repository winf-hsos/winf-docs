  In this unit we learn about applications of AI in practice. We also build our
  own simple ML model to get a better understanding of the topic.

# Hands-On AI

## :arrow\_forward: Learning Unit

### Machine Learning Experiments

We'll use **RapidMiner Studio** and **Azure Machine Learning Studio** to explore, setup and train three machine learning models:

* We'll setup a model to predict whether a person is going to survive the Titanic (RapidMiner)
* We'll try to classify different species of Iris flowers (RapidMiner)
* We'll train classifiers for the handwriting digit recognition (Azure ML)
* We'll train a regression model to predict the result of a spreadsheet calculation (RapidMiner)

### Follow along

You can download RapidMiner Studio and signup for Azure ML Studio if you want to follow along in class, or try it at home:

I'll post a one or two videos on these experiments soon, so everyone can follow through step by step at home.
