# Impacts of Digitalization

## :dart: Learning Objectives <a href="#learning-objectives" id="learning-objectives"></a>

* You know how computers work on a basic level.
* You know what digitization means and how computer represent things from the analog world.
* You know the basics of programming and you can apply them in simple programs.
* You can explain what important digital technologies such as Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence are and why they play a major role for many businesses.
* You can write a program that reads data from sensors and uses that data to trigger some action in the real world.
* You have an understanding of the broad field of artificial intelligence and you can distinguish AI from Machine Learning.
* You can apply cloud services for Machine Learning in your own projects.
* You know properties of digital goods and services and how these lead to new business models and threaten existing ones.
* You can discuss important questions about the future of digital technologies such as AI.

## :flag\_um: Language

This module is part of the international program. For this reason, the language will be English. But don't worry, we'll consider all levels of English, so if you can't follow because of language barriers, we'll try to slow down and repeat. Also, if you can't say it in English, even though you tried, you can always answer in German :flag\_de: .

## :page\_with\_curl: Concept <a href="#concept" id="concept"></a>

This module is divided into :digit\_four: parts.

* :one: Digitization - The basics we need to work with digital technology :digit\_zero::digit\_one:&#x20;
* :two: Coding - The superpower that allows us to tell a computer what to do :keyboard:&#x20;
* :three: Internet of Things - Devices with sensors that we can program :woman\_technologist:&#x20;
* :four: Artificial Intelligence - Algorithms that make our devices smart :alien:&#x20;
* :five: Economic Impacts - The bigger picture of what digitalization does to our world :earth\_americas:&#x20;

In the first part, we'll look at the basics of digitization and we'll try to understand how computers do all these cool things. We then introduce some basic concepts of programming. We need this to implement a prototypical product based on Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Machine Learning algorithms. This prototype is also the subject of the experimental work, which accounts for 70% of the final grade. At the end, we'll look at the bigger picture to see how digitalization leads to new business models and how that affects the economy.

For the experimental part, we rely heavily on group work. Therefore, the two weekly sessions are divided as follows:

* :label: Session 1: Learn new concepts and discuss the topics at hand.
* :test\_tube: Session 2: Maker Lab - Working in groups on the experimental prototype.

The slides from the first session give you more details. You can also [download a PDF version](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kxMBBjJ\_n6rzP6sEudWRxzPB0I6JdiSTWxsT4jAEzN8/export/pdf):

## :speech\_balloon: Continuous Feedback

During the whole semester you can submit your questions, comments, and feedback through a Q\&A online form. We'll address popular questions in class and via Slack. The link to the Q\&A online form is provided in class.

## :level\_slider: Level <a href="#level" id="level"></a>

This is an introductory course, so there are no prerequisites to enroll :smile:. That said, it will help you if you have an understanding of programming :man\_superhero:. But don't worry,  most of you won't and we'll cover everything you need in this course. The primary goal of this course is to tinker :space\_invader: with technology and have fun!

## :scream\_cat: Examination <a href="#examination" id="examination"></a>

Unlike most courses, this one has no final written examination :star\_struck:. Since we are building something awesome throughout the semester in groups, the group's work and result will be 70% of your grade. For the other 30% , you'll take two short MC-test during the semester, each weighing 15%.

## :woman\_technologist: Software & Accounts <a href="#software-and-accounts" id="software-and-accounts"></a>

You need the following tools :tools: and accounts. All tools are free of charge:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Tinkerforge Brick Viewer & Daemon](https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Downloads.html)
* [Microsoft Azure ML Studio](https://studio.azureml.net/)
