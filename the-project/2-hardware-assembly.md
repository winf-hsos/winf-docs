## Smoke Test

The term <mark style="background-color:green;">**smoke test**</mark> in engineering describes a first attempt to run a new system for the first time to see whether there are any major issues. The term smoke test likely originated in the plumbing industry, where smoke was blown into a new pipe system to detect any leaks. For us, the smoke test means that we connect the hardware stack to a computer and test whether all components and their functionalities are working. For this purpose, we can use the [Brick Viewer from Tinkerforge](https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Software/Brickv.html), which we installed in the [previous section](1-development-environment.md).
