# The LiFi-Project

## The project setup

The term [LiFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-Fi) is short for Light-Fidelty and describes a technology to transmit information through the use of light. LiFi uses the visible light spectrum to create a signal using simple devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The light is received by a photodetector that can sense the light emitted by the LED. Through variation of the light's characteristic over time, be it the wavelength or the illuminance, we can encode and transmit data.

You are part of an interdisciplinary research & development (R\&D) team of engineers at a high-tech company that develops and produces robots for applications in food & agriculture. The company sees great potential in the LiFi technology for the fast and secure exchange of information between robots and other peripherals.

## The goal

Your task is to develop a working prototype for a LiFi communication device that can be built into the company's next generation of robots. The two main components of the device are a [small LED](https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Hardware/Bricklets/RGB\_LED\_V2.html) and a [color sensor](https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Hardware/Bricklets/Color\_V2.html). The LED can light up in any of the roughly 16 million colors of the RGB coding system. The color sensor can measure the intensity of the 3 RGB color channels as well as the brightness of the light. A so-called [Master Brick](https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Hardware/Bricks/Master\_Brick.html) is responsible to control both components.

That's all for now! More details follow once you take your first steps.
