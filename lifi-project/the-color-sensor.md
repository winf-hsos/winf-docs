# 11 - The Color Sensor âš¡

<details>

<summary>Summary</summary>

In this lesson, you'll learn:

* How to connect to the color sensor.
* How to read the different values measured by the sensor.
* How to apply the concept of callback functions to be notified of new values.

This lesson is relevant for [Exercise 4: Digitizing the Physical World](https://github.com/winf-hsos/lifi-exercises/raw/main/exercises/04\_exercise\_digitizing\_the\_physical\_world.pdf).

You find the code examples in the [LiFi-code GitHub repository](https://github.com/winf-hsos/LiFi-code) in [`devices/color_sensor.py`](https://github.com/winf-hsos/LiFi-code/blob/main/devices/color\_sensor.py).

## Initialize the Sensor

As with all devices, we must first initialize it and store a reference on a variable so that we can access it later:

```python
color_sensor = BrickletColorV2(constants.UID_COLOR_SENSOR, ipcon)
```

## Read the Current Measurements

As we have seen with [human-input (1).md](<human-input (1).md> "mention"), instead of being automatically informed of new values using a callback function (push principle), we can read the values directly when we need them:

```python
# Read the current measurements (pull principle)
current_color = color_sensor.get_color()
print(f"Current color: R: { current_color.r }, G: { current_color.g } / B: { current_color.b }")
# Output: Current color: R: 22651, G: 24595 / B: 19106

current_illuminance = color_sensor.get_illuminance()
print(current_illuminance)
# Output: 17482

current_color_temperature = color_sensor.get_color_temperature()
print(current_color_temperature)
# Output: 5097
```

This approach of actively asking for the values can be useful in some situations. Most often, however, we wish to be automatically informed about new values. For this, we can apply the concept of callback functions.

## Getting New Values Automatically

Using a callback function involves three steps:

1. Define a callback function with the parameters (if any) for the new values. Note that not all callback functions require a parameter. For example, the rotary encoder's button callbacks do not have any parameters. Calling the function alone is sufficient to indicate that the button was pressed or released.
2. Register the callback function with the device.
3. Configure the callback mechanism to set the interval and potential threshold values.

Let's look at how this can be done for the color values of the sensor. The sensor measures 4 different aspects of the color, which according to the [Tinkerforge API documentation](https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Software/Bricklets/ColorV2\_Bricklet\_Python.html#color-v2-bricklet-python-api) translates to four parameters:

```python
# 1. Define the callback function
def new_color_value(r, g, b, c):
    print(f"R: { r }, G: { g }, B: { b }, C: { c }")
```

Next, we can take the function's name `new_color_value` and pass it to the `register_listener` function. As the first parameter, we need to specify the type of event we want to register the callback function for. In this case, we can reference this type using the provided constant `CALLBACK_COLOR` from the color sensor's API:

```python
# 2. Register the callback function
color_sensor.register_callback(BrickletColorV2.CALLBACK_COLOR, new_color_value)
```

Finally, we must configure the callback mechanism. In the example below, we ask for a new value every second (1000 milliseconds) and we specify that the values don't have to change:

```python
color_sensor.set_color_callback_configuration(1000, False)
```

From now on, we'll get a call to `new_color_value` every second, receiving a new color value. We can decide what we want to do with that value. In the LiFi prototype, we want to convey information using light signals. Using different colors and recognizing them might be useful for that. We'll dwell on this topic in the upcoming lesson [9-the-color-sensor.md](9-the-color-sensor.md "mention").

For examples of the other two values, color temperature and illuminance, refer to the [example code in the LiFi repository on GitHub](https://github.com/winf-hsos/LiFi-code/blob/main/examples/color\_sensor.py).
