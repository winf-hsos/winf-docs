## The RGB Code

In the previous section about [the-led.md](the-led.md "mention"), we briefly touched the RGB code and used it to set the LED's color to green. We did this using a function provided by the Tinkerforge <mark style="background-color:green;">**API**</mark> called `set_rgb_value`. When calling this function, we passed three numbers to it:

```python
led.set_rgb_value(0, 255, 0)
```

### The RGB Code In A Nutshell

It is now time to understand what these three numbers mean and what values we can assign to each of them. The short answer is: the numbers belong to the RGB code, which is a code system that uses 3 <mark style="background-color:green;">**bytes**</mark> to represent one of roughly 16 million colors. The abbreviation RGB stands for the three colors **r**ed, **g**reen, and **b**lue. The RGB code specifies the intensity for each of these three basic colors to create the desired resulting color. The RGB code reserves one byte for each of the three basic colors, hence 3 bytes in total. Knowing that, we understand why the above code line produces a pure green color. All basic colors are set to zero, except green, which is set to 255, the largest possible number we can store in one byte.

That was a lot! Let's unpack this.

### Why \~16 Million Colors?

With the RGB code, we can represent exactly $$16,777,216$$ different colors. That's what I meant above by saying "roughly 16 million". The reason is simple mathematics: A color in the RGB code is defined by a mix of the three basic colors red, green, and blue. For each basic color, we can specify an intensity between 0 (none of that color) and 255 (full intensity). This makes 256 possible values for one basic color. Because we can combine all possible values of the three basic colors, and each results in a different color, the RGB code can represent

$$
256 \times 256 \times 256 = 16,777,216
$$

different colors. But why is it that for each basic color, we can specify the intensity between 0 and the seemingly arbitrary upper limit of 255? The answer lies is the byte.

### What Is A Byte And Why 255?

Simply put, a byte is a sequence of eight digits that can be either 0 or 1. A digit that can either be 0 or 1 is called a <mark style="background-color:green;">**bit**</mark>, which is short for <mark style="background-color:green;">**binary digit**</mark>. So eight bits equal one <mark style="background-color:green;">**byte**</mark>.

So, what about the 255? Well, 255 is the largest <mark style="background-color:green;">**decimal number**</mark> we can represent with one byte (or 8 bits). We'll discuss the [binary-numbers.md](binary-numbers.md "mention") in more detail later on, but here is the quick explanation: If we only had one bit, how many numbers could we represent with it? That's simple, only two: 0 and 1. But what if we had two bits? How many numbers can we represent then? We can figure this out by calculating the number of permutations we can create from two digits with two possible values: $$2 \times 2 = 4$$. What if we had three bits? Well: $$2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8$$. In general, for $$n$$ bits, we can calculate the number of combinations as $$2^n$$. Thus, the answer for eight bits (or one byte) is $$2^8 = 256$$. That means, we can represent numbers between 0 and 255, which makes 256 different values. And since the RGB code uses one byte for each of the three basic colors, the intensity can be a number between 0 and 255.

### What Does The Weird Hashtag Mean?

Occasionally, you see colors being specified in a format that starts with a hashtag symbol followed by 6 numbers or letters. This is the RGB code expressed as a <mark style="background-color:green;">**hexadecimal number**</mark>. The <mark style="background-color:green;">**hexadecimal system**</mark> is often used to express the value of a byte because in this system we can write one byte with only two symbols. This makes it very compact.&#x20;

The color "#00FF00" corresponds to full green: the first two "00" digits represent the first byte, which in the RGB code stands for the intensity of red, which is zero here. The next two digits "FF" stand for the intensity of green, and "FF" is the largest possible value for a two-digit hexadecimal number. "FF" is 255 in decimal. The last pair "00" is for the intensity of blue, which is also zero.

You will learn more about the hexadecimal system when we introduce [binary-numbers.md](binary-numbers.md "mention") alongside the general idea of <mark style="background-color:green;">**number systems**</mark>.

## ASCII Code

## Other Code Systems

Although in this project, we use code systems in the context of digital computers, code systems do not necessarily have any relation to ones and zeroes whatsoever. There were code systems invented long before the digital computer. The [Morse code](broken-reference), which we'll explore in more detail in the next section, is a good example. And there are others, was well.

### QR- And Barcodes



### Braille Code

Braille is a system of raised dots that can be felt with the fingertips. It is used by people who are blind or visually impaired to read and write. Braille consists of six dots arranged in a pattern that represents a letter, number, or punctuation mark. The dots are arranged in two columns of three dots each, with each dot in a column numbered from one to three from top to bottom.

For example, the letter "A" is represented by a single dot in the upper-left corner of the cell, while the letter "B" is represented by dots in the upper left and lower left corners of the cell. The letter "C" is represented by dots in the upper right and lower left corners of the cell, and so on.

Here's an example of the word "hello" in braille (created with [https://www.brailletranslator.org](https://www.brailletranslator.org/)):

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/hello_braille.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Each letter is represented by a combination of dots, and the letters are arranged in left-to-right order, just like in regular text.

### Genetic Code (DNA)

The genetic code is the set of rules that determines how nucleotide triplets (codons) in DNA and RNA encode the 20 standard amino acids that make up proteins. There are $$4^3 = 64$$ possible codons, but only 20 different amino acids to code for. This means that the code is degenerate, meaning that multiple codons can encode for the same amino acid. For example, the amino acid leucine can be coded for by six different codons: UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG.

The genetic code is read by cellular machinery called ribosomes, which are large molecular complexes made up of RNA and protein. The ribosome reads the codons in the messenger RNA (mRNA) and uses them to assemble a chain of amino acids in the correct order to make a protein. The process of assembling a protein from the genetic code is called translation.

The genetic code is universal, meaning that the same code is used by all living organisms on Earth. This is a testament to the fundamental importance of the genetic code for life as we know it.

### Music Notation

The system of music notation uses a set of five horizontal lines and four spaces, on which these symbols are placed. Each line and space represents a different pitch, and the symbols placed on them indicate the duration and timing of the note. For example, a solid black circle placed on the second line from the bottom represents a note played at a specific pitch and held for a specific length of time. The position of the note on the staff and the symbols used to represent it create a code that musicians can read to play the correct notes at the correct time. By combining different notes in specific patterns, musicians can create melodies and harmonies that make up the music we hear.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Some random music notation generated by <a href="http://www.randomsheetmusic.com/">http://www.randomsheetmusic.com</a></p></figcaption></figure>

Notes are the basic symbols used to represent musical sounds in music notation. Different types of notes, such as whole notes, half notes, quarter notes, and so on, are used to represent different durations of sound. But the music notation system encodes more than just notes:

* Rests: Rests are symbols used to indicate periods of silence in music. They come in different durations that correspond to the different types of notes.
* Clefs: Clefs are symbols that are placed at the beginning of a musical staff to indicate the pitch range of the music. The most common clefs are the treble clef and bass clef.
* Time signatures: Time signatures are symbols that are placed at the beginning of a piece of music to indicate the meter or rhythm of the music. They consist of two numbers, one above the other, with the top number indicating the number of beats in each measure and the bottom number indicating the duration of each beat.
* Accidentals: Accidentals are symbols that are used to modify the pitch of a note. The most common accidentals are the sharp (#), flat (b), and natural (‚ôÆ) signs.
* Dynamics: Dynamics are symbols that are used to indicate the volume or intensity of the music. Examples include p (piano, meaning soft), f (forte, meaning loud), and crescendo/decrescendo symbols that indicate a gradual increase or decrease in volume.

### Morse Code

Morse code is a system of communication that uses a series of short and long signals to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation. These signals can be transmitted using sound or light, such as through a telegraph, flashlight, or radio signal. Each signal in Morse code is known as a "dot" or a "dash", and they are combined to form the code for each letter or symbol.

For example, the letter "A" in Morse code is represented by a short signal (dot) followed by a long signal (dash), which is written as ".-" (dot-dash). The letter "S" is represented by three short signals (dots), which is written as "..." (dot-dot-dot). Spaces between letters are represented by short pauses, while spaces between words are represented by longer pauses.

Morse code is a useful system for communication in situations where speech or text-based messages may not be possible or practical. It was originally used for long-distance communication through telegraph lines, and later adapted for use in radio communication. Today, it is still used by some amateur radio operators and in certain specialized fields, such as aviation and emergency services.

## Code Systems In General

You have just learned that the RGB code uses a total of $$2^{24}=16,777,216$$ numbers and assigns to each a specific color. All other code systems work the same way. We have a code, which for computers is always a number, and we assign a meaning to this code. The two questions we need to ask are:

* How many codes do I need? That is, how many things do I need to represent with that code? In RGB code, that is 16,777,216 colors that need to be encoded.
* How many bits do we need to represent the number of different codes? In RGB code, that is 24 bits or 3 bytes.

## What About Communication?

The LiFi-project is about communication, so we ought to look at a code system that was designed for that purpose and see whether it can help us solve our problem. You have probably heard about the [Morse code](broken-reference) before.&#x20;
