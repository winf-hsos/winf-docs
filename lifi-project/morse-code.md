## Summary

In this section, you'll learn:

* How Morse code works as a code system that originated before the digital computer revolution.
* That code systems work independent of the medium used for transmission of the signal.

## What is Morse code?

Morse code is a system of communication that uses a series of short and long signals to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation. These signals can be transmitted using sound or light, such as through a telegraph, flashlight, or radio signal. Each signal in Morse code is known as a "dot" or a "dash", and they are combined to form the code for each letter or symbol.

For example, the letter "A" in Morse code is represented by a short signal (dot) followed by a long signal (dash), which is written as ".-" (dot-dash). The letter "S" is represented by three short signals (dots), which is written as "..." (dot-dot-dot). Spaces between letters are represented by short pauses, while spaces between words are represented by longer pauses.

Morse code is a useful system for communication in situations where speech or text-based messages may not be possible or practical. It was originally used for long-distance communication through telegraph lines, and later adapted for use in radio communication. Today, it is still used by some amateur radio operators and in certain specialized fields, such as aviation and emergency services.
