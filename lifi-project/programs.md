## Code For This Section

This section introduces a program for the smoke test, which we go through step-by-step. You can find [the program code on GitHub](https://github.com/winf-hsos/LiFi-code/blob/main/examples/smoke\_test.py), and I recommend you check out the entire [LiFi-code repository](https://github.com/winf-hsos/LiFi-code) with all examples in this course.

## What Is A Program?

### Instructions

A program is a set of instructions for a computer to execute. A program is written as plain text, and all we need is a basic text editor, although in the LiFi-project, we prefer a [complete development environment](development-environment.md).&#x20;

When a computer runs a program, it goes through the program one line at a time and does what each line - or <mark style="background-color:green;">**instruction**</mark> - tells it to do. However, sometimes the program has special instructions called <mark style="background-color:green;">**loops**</mark>, <mark style="background-color:green;">**control structures**</mark>, and <mark style="background-color:green;">**functions**</mark> that make the computer do things in a different order. These instructions can make the computer repeat certain actions many times, or skip over certain lines of code altogether. Don't worry if you don't understand these concepts yet, we'll be talking more about them soon.

An instruction is telling the computer what to do. There are different types of instructions, and they are used in combination to solve problems. In a program, we use instructions to tell a computer to:

* Remember things.
* Calculate things.
* Do things over and over again.
* Do one thing or the other, depending on the outcome of a decision.
* Recycle things we taught it how to do, so we don't have to repeat ourselves.

### Five types of instructions in programming

The above list of things a computer can do translate into five general types of instructions in programming that you will need to understand and master throughout the LiFi-project:

1. <mark style="background-color:green;">**Variables**</mark> (_remember things_)
2. <mark style="background-color:green;">**Expressions**</mark> (_calculate things_)
3. <mark style="background-color:green;">**Loops**</mark> (_do things over and over_)
4. <mark style="background-color:green;">**Control structures**</mark> (_do one thing or the other_)
5. <mark style="background-color:green;">**Functions**</mark> (_recycle things we taught it_)

The great news is: Once you understand the concept behind each of them, you can read and write almost any program, no matter the complexity. These concepts are the DNA of every program. Of course, it takes practice. And you may still have to look up specific keywords for the language you are programming in. But that's where [Google](https://app.gitbook.com/u/5a55d1d8d10859002f1ae2f5), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) come in. Seriously, they are every programmer's best buddies. Learn to use them.

### 1. Variables

Think of a variable as a container with a label on it. You can put things into the container and at any time you can ask for the content of the container, given you know the container's label. You can change the content of the container as you like at any time.

In a program, a variable is actually a pointer to an address in the computer's main memory. By calling the variable by its name, you are taken to this particular location in the computer's memory, and you can access whatever has been stored there. You can also overwrite the memory location with a value of your choice. A memory address is simply a number that identifies a specific location in memory. Variables exist, so we can store and access things in memory from within our program.&#x20;

We define a variable in Python by writing the desired name and assigning a value using the `=` symbol:

```python
last_name = "Meseth"
first_name = "Nicolas"
age = 41
```

We are more or less free in choosing a variable's name. There are only few rules and some conventions:

* Variable names should start with a small letter (_convention_).&#x20;
* Variables names cannot start with a number (_rule_).
* Variable names cannot contain any special characters, except the underscore "`_`" (_rule_).
* Variable names should be speaking so that we can infer what the variable's original intentional use was (_convention_).
* When a variable name is composed of more than one word, we use an underscore to connect the two (or more) words (as in `last_name`). An alternative would be so-called camel-casing, where the two words are not separated, but a new word starts with a capital letter (e.g., `lastName`). Camel-casing is not conventional in Python.

### 2. Expressions

### 3. Loops

### 4. Control structures

### 5. Functions

## Create Once, Use Often

An important principle in programming is "Don't Repeat Yourself". Code that we need in several places of our program should be given a name and wrapped in a function. We saw how to do this [earlier in this section](programs.md#5.-functions). We can simply call functions like any other command from anywhere in our program.&#x20;

### Modules

If we put all our custom created, useful functions into a file and call it, for example, `useful_funcs.py` ,we have created a so-called <mark style="background-color:green;">**module**</mark>.

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw (2).svg" alt="A module is a collection of useful functions in a Python-file." class="gitbook-drawing">

The great benefit of modules is that we can reuse and import them in different programs. These can be our programs or the program's from someone else. The latter requires that person to have a copy of our module:

### Libraries

If you program for a longer time, you might at some point have written so many functions that it makes sense you create separate modules for them. You now have a set of Python-files, each containing functions that address a common problem or belong together in some other way. If in turn those modules somehow belong together because they too address a common, but larger issue, you can bundle those modules into a so-called <mark style="background-color:green;">**library**</mark>. Look at the example below, where the three modules `geometry.py`, `algebra.py`, and `arithemtic.py` each contain functions to solve specific problems from a particular domain. However, the modules share that they all solve mathematical problems. It therefore makes sense to group them into a library called `Math`.

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw (1).svg" alt="A library is a collection of related modules." class="gitbook-drawing">

So, here is the difference between a module and a library: a module is a _collection of functions_ that live in one Python-file. A library is a _collection of related modules_ bundled together. So in that sense, a library is bigger than a module.

### GitHub and PyPI

When we're happy with our library, we can share it with the world. There are different options for that, but the online-platform <mark style="background-color:green;">**GitHub**</mark> is a great place to start. On GitHub, we can publish code and others can get inspired or re-use that code in their projects. The code examples for this course live on GitHub, too:

{% embed url="https://github.com/winf-hsos/LiFi-code" %}

Another way for everyone to use your library is to have it listed in the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/), which allows to download and install your library with one line on the command line:

```
pip install my_library
```

After this command ran successfully, one can import functions from the library in their programs like this:

```python
from my_library import calc_C
```

From now on, the function `calc_C` can be used in that program like any other function.

It is important to note that a library can contain not just functions, but is often used to declare costant values, too. This is in fact a use case in our LiFi-project.
