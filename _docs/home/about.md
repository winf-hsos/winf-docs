# Why this documentation section?
As a feedback from previous semesters, students expressed the desire to have a collection of technical documentation around the topics we touch during the different courses. In an academic context, this often called a *script*. Indeed, we are extensively working with different tools and technologies, and I can fully understand this desire. I myself find such a central documentation platform a very good idea. The documentation section is the attempt to answer the student's feedback and hopefully make the courses even more successful.
